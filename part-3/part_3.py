# Follow the instructions in this part of the project. Define and flesh out your function below, which should accept a dictionary as an argument when called, and return a string of the info in that book-dictionary in a user-friendly readable format.

# Code below
def get_all():
    pass



# Once you are finished with that function, create several more functions which return individual pieces of information from the book.

# Code below
def get_title():
    pass

def get_author():
    pass

def get_year():
    pass

def get_rating():
    pass

def get_pages():
    pass

# Finally, create at least three new functions that might be useful as we expand our home library app. Perhaps think of a way you could accept additional arguments when the function is called? Also, imagine you have a list filled with dictionaries like above.

# Code below

def order_by_size(lst):
    pass

def print_books_by_author(lst):
